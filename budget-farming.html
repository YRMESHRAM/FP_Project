        <h2>1. Crop Rotation</h2>
        <p>Crop rotation involves the practice of alternating different types of crops in the same area across seasons. This method improves soil structure, optimizes nutrients, and interrupts the life cycles of pests, making it a cost-effective approach to maintaining healthy crops.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Prevents soil depletion and improves nutrient content naturally.</li>
                <li>Reduces dependence on fertilizers and pesticides, lowering input costs.</li>
                <li>Minimizes the impact of soil-borne diseases, reducing crop loss.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Key Crops:</h3>
            <p>Common rotations include legumes (which fix nitrogen), cereals (like wheat or corn), and root crops (such as potatoes or carrots).</p>
        </div>

                <li>Offers cash flow at the start of the season, helping with planning and budgeting.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>CSA Models:</h3>
            <p>Farmers can offer weekly or bi-weekly boxes of produce to customers, ensuring fresh produce delivery while minimizing waste and storage costs.</p>
        </div>
