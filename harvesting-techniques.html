        <h2>1. Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
        <p>Rainwater harvesting captures and stores water for use during summer. It involves collecting rainwater from rooftops and channeling it into storage systems.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>How It Works:</h3>
            <p>Rainwater is collected from roofs using gutters and downspouts, then directed into storage tanks, ponds, or underground reservoirs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Key Components:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Catchment Area:</strong> Captures rainwater, usually from a roof.</li>
                <li><strong>Gutters and Downspouts:</strong> Direct water from the catchment area to the storage system.</li>
                <li><strong>First-Flush Diverter:</strong> Removes the initial contaminated water to prevent pollutants from entering the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Tank:</strong> Stores harvested water; should be covered to avoid contamination.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtration System:</strong> Screens or filters remove debris before water enters the storage system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces dependence on external water sources.</li>
                <li>Provides backup water supply during dry spells.</li>
                <li>Enhances groundwater recharge.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>2. Check Dams and Percolation Pits</h2>
        <p>Check dams and percolation pits capture runoff and improve groundwater recharge, especially in areas with seasonal streams.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Check Dams:</h3>
            <p>Barriers made of stone, concrete, or sandbags slow water flow, allowing more infiltration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Increases groundwater, reduces soil erosion, and provides water for nearby irrigation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Percolation Pits:</h3>
            <p>Pits are dug to capture water and enhance infiltration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Tips:</strong> Line with stones or gravel to prevent erosion.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Recharges wells, reduces runoff, and improves soil moisture.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>3. Contour Bunding and Terracing</h2>
        <p>Contour bunding and terracing are techniques used on sloped land to reduce water runoff, prevent soil erosion, and enhance water retention in the soil.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Contour Bunding:</h3>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Small embankments or bunds are constructed along the natural contours of the land. These bunds slow down the flow of water, allowing it to seep into the ground.</p>
            <p><strong>Construction Tips:</strong> Use local materials like stones, soil, and vegetation to reinforce bunds and prevent breaching during heavy rain.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces soil erosion, improves water retention, and enhances groundwater recharge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Terracing:</h3>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Sloped land is converted into a series of flat terraces that hold water and reduce runoff. Terracing is ideal for hilly areas with significant slopes.</p>
            <p><strong>Construction Tips:</strong> Ensure terraces are properly graded to prevent waterlogging and are stabilized with vegetation to prevent erosion.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Maximizes land use, improves water retention, and reduces soil erosion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhances agricultural productivity on sloped terrains.</li>
                <li>Promotes sustainable land management practices.</li>
                <li>Helps in maintaining soil fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>4. Farm Ponds</h2>
        <p>Farm ponds are artificial ponds dug within the farm to collect and store runoff water. They serve as a reliable water source for irrigation, livestock, and other farm needs.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>How It Works:</h3>
            <p>Ponds are strategically located to capture runoff from surrounding fields or diverted streams. They are usually lined with clay or polythene to reduce seepage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Construction Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Size the pond based on water needs, land area, and expected runoff.</li>
                <li>Install silt traps to prevent sediment from accumulating in the pond.</li>
                <li>Use natural barriers like bunds around the pond to prevent surface contamination.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides an on-farm water source.</li>
                <li>Helps with groundwater recharge.</li>
                <li>Acts as a buffer during dry periods.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>5. Recharge Wells</h2>
        <p>Recharge wells are deep structures that facilitate the direct infiltration of surface runoff into aquifers, boosting groundwater levels.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>How It Works:</h3>
            <p>Excess rainwater or surface runoff is directed into recharge wells, which are typically deep enough to reach permeable soil layers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Design Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recharge wells should be strategically placed in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.</li>
                <li>Use gravel or sand filters at the entrance to prevent blockages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves the availability of groundwater for irrigation and domestic use, particularly during dry seasons.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>6. Soil Moisture Conservation Techniques</h2>
        <p>These techniques focus on maintaining the moisture content of the soil, reducing the frequency and amount of irrigation required.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Mulching:</h3>
            <p>Applying organic (straw, leaves) or inorganic (plastic sheets) mulch around plants helps reduce evaporation, maintain soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Cover Cropping:</h3>
            <p>Growing cover crops like legumes in off-seasons improves soil structure, enhances water infiltration, and reduces erosion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Deep Plowing:</h3>
            <p>Conducting deep plowing at the beginning of the season helps break compacted layers of soil, increasing its water retention capacity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">

            <h2>7. Community Water Harvesting Structures</h2>
            <p>In some regions, community-based water harvesting structures like shared ponds or check dams are built through collective efforts.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>How It Works:</h3>
                <p>These are larger, communal versions of individual harvesting structures, serving multiple farms or villages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">

            <p>Silt traps and diversion channels help manage surface water flow, reducing sedimentation in water storage structures.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Silt Traps:</h3>
                <p>Structures designed to catch silt and debris before water enters ponds or tanks, maintaining storage capacity and water quality.</p>
